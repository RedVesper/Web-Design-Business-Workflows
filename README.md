# Web Design Business Workflows
Describes processes and workflows for operating a web design business

This is an effort to document the tasks involved in running a web design business. 
It is partly inspired by Eli's video "Workflow for technology professionals".

Common tasks or processes should be indexed here and described in detail below or on a separate page. 
The flow between these tasks should be made explicit so that no doubt can arise as to which process to follow.
If a template doesn't exist, it should be created. 
I would welcome pull requests with undocumented processes that are common to web design businesses.

Processes: 

* Discovery phase (request for proposal)...
* Creating a proposal
* On-boarding...
* Scheduling initial build...
* Revisions...
* Content updates...
* Software updates
* Generating an invoice
* Invoice payment reminder
*
